Install the [LazyVim](https://github.com/lirubao/nvim-config)

- Make a backup of your current Neovim files:

  ```sh
  # required
  mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

  # optional but recommended
  mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
  mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
  mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
  ```

- Clone the starter

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/lirubao/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
  ```

- Remove the `.git` folder, so you can add it to your own repo later

  ```sh
  rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
  ```

- Start Neovim!

  ```sh
  nvim
  ```
